This paper presents an accelerated approach for drug discovery that utilizes active learning to identify potential drug candidates more efficiently. Traditional methods for drug discovery are based on screening large chemical libraries and performing high throughput assays, which are both time consuming and expensive. In this project, we use batch active learning to sample the most informative instances and make conclusions about potential drugs in a more efficient manner. We use passive learning as a baseline, and compare it to the performance of batch uncertainty sampling and batch density based sampling to select the most promising next potential targets to test, both of which outperform traditional methods. This approach will thus help reduce the number of experiments required to identify promising drug candidates. Our results suggest that active learning has the potential to significantly accelerate the drug discovery process, while also reducing costs.
